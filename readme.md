# Get the Flag  

A simple JS canvas game, almost without libraries.

You are a player that can freely move in 2D space. The objective is to touch a certain random point (the "flag"), after which your movement speed gets faster, your score is incremented, and the flag gets randomly relocated.

Use WASD or the arrow keys to move.
